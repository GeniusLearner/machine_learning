## Final Project for ML in Python

In this project, We will complete a notebook where you will build a classifier to predict whether a loan case will be paid off or not.

You load a historical dataset from loan applications, clean the data, and apply different classification algorithm on the data. You are expected to use the following algorithms to build your models:

    k-Nearest Neighbour
    Decision Tree
    Support Vector Machine
    Logistic Regression

The results is reported as the accuracy of each classifier, using the following metrics when these are applicable:

    Jaccard index
    F1-score
    LogLoass
    
## Keras.ipynb
 
In this you will build a regression model using the deep learning Keras library, and then you will experiment with increasing the number of training epochs and changing number of hidden layers and you will see how changing these parameters impacts the performance of the model.
 
For your convenience, the data can be found here again: https://cocl.us/concrete_data. To recap, the predictors in the data of concrete strength include:

    Cement
    Blast Furnace Slag
    Fly Ash
    Water
    Superplasticizer
    Coarse Aggregate
    Fine Aggregate
    
## Pytorch 
    
In this lab, you will use pre-trained models to classify between the negative and positive samples; you will be provided with the dataset object. The particular pre-trained model will be resnet18; you will have three questions:

    change the output layer
    train the model
    identify several misclassified samples

## Resnet 

In this we will build another classifier using another pre-trained model, namely the VGG16 model, following the same steps we completed in the previous module {Pytorch} using the ResNet50 pre-trained model. Then you will test the classifiers on a test set.
